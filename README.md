# Market Segmentation using Tableau and R

It is necessary to comprehend customer-level heterogeneity or variations to grasp consumers (Hahn et al., 2002). In much of the literature on applied econometrics, heterogeneity is often viewed as an incidental nuisance that needs to be resolved but is not the focus of the investigation. Instead, the focus is on assessing the average impact of policy variables (Allenby and Rossi, 1998). Models that ignore heterogeneity could provide very skewed results about the nature of correlations between variables and, as a result, lead to misleading conclusions (Ansari et al., 2000). Decisions to measure customer satisfaction at the segment level are only possible by understanding individual or market segment differences in the formation of overall satisfaction ratings and the consequent heterogeneity in the role of these various determinants, although aggregated market-level research to understand the determinants of customer satisfaction abounds (Allenby and Rossi, 1998; Wu et al., 2006). Methods for market research that worked well in a relationship-based environment with repeated choices would not work so well in a transaction-based environment with initial decisions, so these approaches should be complemented with explicitly dynamic techniques (Rust and Huang, 2014). The same IT elements that fuel the service economy are also changing the appropriate toolbox for marketing analytics, with a focus on computationally intensive data analysis of consumer databases (Rust and Huang, 2014).

This project aims to solve the challenge of capturing a new market by a restaurant chain by identifying the right demographic and psychographic features of the customers to increase profitability in a new market and find the best approaches using visualisations on Tableau and by performing cluster analysis using R.
